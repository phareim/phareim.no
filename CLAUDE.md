# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with host option
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run generate` - Generate static site
- `npm run preview` - Preview the built application

### Project Setup
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run postinstall` - Prepare Nuxt (runs automatically after install)

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Nuxt 3** personal website with multiple interactive features:

### Core Structure
- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Nuxt 3 framework using Composition API and Options API patterns
- **Backend**: Nuxt server API routes in `server/api/` 
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for persistent data storage
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + custom CSS with Comfortaa font
- **State Management**: Pinia for client-side state

### Key Features & Architecture

#### 1. Blog System (`server/api/blog.ts`, `blog/` directory)
- Markdown-based blog posts with front matter support
- File-based content management in `/blog` directory
- Automatic parsing of YAML front matter and date extraction from filenames
- Server-side rendering of markdown to HTML using markdown-it

#### 2. Text-Based RPG Game
- **State Management**: Firebase-persisted game state in `server/rpg/state/game-state.ts`
- **AI Integration**: Venice AI API (OpenAI-compatible) for dynamic responses
- **Command System**: Text-based commands processed in `server/api/rpg.ts`
- **Game Logic**: Modular handlers in `server/rpg/handlers/` for movement, AI responses, items, and places
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces in `types/` directory

#### 3. AI-Powered Content Generation
- **Image Generation**: FAL AI integration for image-to-image processing
- **Text Generation**: Multiple AI APIs (Venice AI, OpenAI) for dynamic content
- **Place/Item Generation**: Procedural generation using AI for RPG content

### Environment Configuration
- Runtime config in `nuxt.config.ts` handles both server-side secrets and client-side public keys
- Firebase configuration split between admin (server) and client SDK
- Multiple API keys: VENICE_KEY, FAL_KEY, Firebase credentials

### Component Architecture
- **Global Components**: MenuComponent with keyboard shortcut (M key) for navigation
- **RPG Components**: Specialized UI components in `components/rpg/` for game interface
- **Reusable Components**: ProfileCard, SocialLink for common UI patterns

### API Structure
- RESTful endpoints in `server/api/` following Nuxt conventions
- Nested routing for resource collections (blogposts, items, places)
- Firebase Admin SDK for server-side database operations
- Error handling with H3 utilities (createError, defineEventHandler)

### File-Based Routing
- Pages in `pages/` directory following Nuxt file-based routing
- Nested routes for blog (`pages/blog/`) and RPG (`pages/rpg/`)
- Draft pages in `pages/drafts/` for experimental features

### Key Technical Patterns
- **Server Utilities**: Firebase Admin in `server/utils/firebase-admin.ts`
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all major features
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across API endpoints
- **Client-Server Communication**: H3 event handlers with proper request/response typing

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Viewport meta configuration prevents zooming on mobile
- Responsive design considerations throughout the codebase

### Global Keyboard Shortcuts
- 'M' key toggles main menu (disabled on RPG and image-generator pages)
- Body scroll control based on page context
