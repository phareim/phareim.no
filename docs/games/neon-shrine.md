## Neon Shrine — the Zelda-like, and phareim.no's world (rebuilt 2026-09-22, one world with the portal 2026-09-24)

Neon Shrine is a full A Link to the Past–style adventure in 80s neon paint:
scrolling overworld, the Keeper's hut, shop, cave, a ten-room dungeon with
keys, a block puzzle, crystal switches, a miniboss and a two-phase boss.
About 20–30 minutes to finish. Since 2026-09-24 it is not a theme of its
own: its overworld begins in the town on `/` (the portal,
`docs/games/portal.md`), and the coast road east out of town leads to the
Keeper's hut. `?theme=zelda` is a legacy id and shows the portal. The
sword, items, pause menu and saves work the same in the town and out on
the coast. Design (story, maps, progression, enemies, look):
`themes/zelda/DESIGN.md`.

The 2026-09-16/21 version (two 15×11 rooms, Muse-built engine) was replaced
wholesale on 2026-09-22; it is in git history up to `a110530`. The separate
theme page (title screen, attract mode, the hut's back door THE WAY HOME)
is in git history before the one-world merge.

**Files.** `types.ts` is the contract. `world/` — maps as string grids with
marker chars: `overworld.ts` (town + coast, 104×48), `town.ts` (the arcade
and Petter's house, `HIGH_SCORE_SIGN`), `interiors.ts` (hut, shop, cave),
`shrine.ts`, `intro.ts` (the Keeper's story), tile behaviour (`tiles.ts`),
`validate.ts`. `index.ts` holds `WORLD` (start: the plaza), `worldExits()`
and `worldStartingAt()`. `engine/` — pure simulation split by concern
(`game.ts` modes/saves/camera/exits/area intros, `hero.ts`, `enemies.ts`,
`objects.ts`, `combat.ts`, `map.ts`). `render/` — `renderer.ts`,
`tiles.ts`, `sprites.ts` + `sheet.ts`, `font.ts`, `hud.ts`. `audio.ts` —
music, jingles, SFX. `Zelda.vue` — the world shell (loop, input, touch
deck, audio, saves, pause menu, exits, navigation lock), mounted by
`themes/portal/Landing.vue`. `profileSync.ts` — the profile pull.
`progress.ts` — quest steps and the save merge. `hiscore.ts` — a real top
three on the arcade's HIGH SCORES sign (one Hall of Fame game at random,
`/api/leaderboard` without a player id; offline it keeps the KNG joke).

**How it starts.** A visitor stands on the plaza with nothing. Walking
into Home Glade without the blade, the Keeper tells the story once (the
area's `intro`, flag `intro`); the blade's chest is beside the hut door.
Before the blade there is no HUD, no swing, no B buzz, and the play clock
(`state.elapsed`) stands still; it starts with the blade. `createGame(world,
{ save, at })` puts the hero at `at` (the plaza, or in front of the exit
last used) with the save's items; a save's own continue point only matters
for death during a session.

**Controls.** Keys: arrows/WASD move; Space/J/Z/Enter = A (sword, talk,
open, lift, throw, use an exit; hold after a swing, release to spin);
K/X/Shift = B (item); Q, or Tab when there is an item, swaps; P or an
Escape tap pauses (items, heart pieces, the current quest); on the pause
screen R asks START OVER? (Enter/Y yes, Esc/P/N no) and T goes to town.
Holding Escape saves and goes to town. Touch: floating stick on the left
60 %, A always, B and SWAP once there is an item, a pause chip (paused:
RESUME, START OVER with a yes/no step, TO TOWN); any tap moves a dialog on;
a tap on the right of the world also swings. With the blade, portrait
phones get a console band under the view; before it, and in landscape, the
buttons float over the world.

**Saves (on the profile since 2026-09-23).** The save belongs to the
browser's Hall of Fame player — the same pilot as the scores and the Hangar
ship. Nothing is written before the hero has the blade, so a visitor who
only walks round the town never becomes a player. `localStorage.zeldaSave`
(`SAVE_VERSION` 2: continue point, max hearts, inventory, flags, rng, play
time, `savedAt`) is the instant copy; every write also goes to the
player's slot `zelda` through `POST /api/save` (`composables/useGameSave.ts`,
one request in flight, keepalive). Written on every map entry, item,
secret, door, gate, boss, respawn, exit, TO TOWN and when the tab is
hidden. On load the shell starts on the local copy and pulls the slot in
the background; `reconcile` in `progress.ts` keeps the newer write, and a
newer profile save replaces the run at the next calm frame only if this
session has not saved yet. A new game or a win (a cleared slot, remembered
locally as `zeldaClearedAt`) is not undone by an older copy. Best times
meet at the lower (`zeldaBest` locally, `best_seconds` on the slot, which
also counts clears). The Hangar shows QUEST n/7 from the slot. A player is
still one browser, so the save does not follow a person to another device.

**Exits.** An `exit` marker (`ExitDef` in `types.ts`) is a way out of the
game: walk onto a door exit, or press A at a solid one and read its lines,
and the door fade runs; at full dark the engine emits `{ type: 'exit', id,
to }` and stays in mode `exit`. All exits are in the town (cabinets, board,
HANGAR door, kiosk, signpost, terminals); the shell saves and navigates.

**Checks.** `npm run test:zelda` (in CI, 20 tests, green 2026-09-24): world
validation (everything reachable from the plaza), the first minute (the
coast road from the town, the Keeper's story once, no clock before the
blade, the blade chest; out of the hut door in ~0.22 s with input ignored;
a save continuing at the plaza or a cabinet with its items;
swing/cut/spin, lift/throw), the hut (one door, in and out), exits on a
small fixture world (cabinet with lines, solid exit without, door, the
entries beside them, validator errors), the rules before the blade, saves
and death, and a **full scripted run** from the hut to the Sun Prism with
a path-finding walker (god mode, bosses killed directly) — it proves every
key, gate, crystal, push block and appear-chest is wired. The town's own
checks are `test:portal`. `node scripts/zelda-lab/shot.mjs <outDir>
[scenes]` renders the real renderer for named scenes without Nuxt (`r-*`
are the town, `r-road` the coast road); `scripts/zelda-lab/cdp.mjs` is a
small DevTools driver (no puppeteer on Sleeper) for headless play in the
dev server, which exposes `window.__zelda` (and `__portal`) in dev only.
Headless play verified 2026-09-24 (see `docs/games/portal.md`). **Not
yet:** physical-phone feel, music heard by a person, full manual
play-through.
